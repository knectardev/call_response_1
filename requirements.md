# Pitch Detection Application Requirements

## Overview
A web-based pitch detection application that allows users to detect and visualize musical notes in real-time using their microphone input. The application provides real-time feedback, visualization, and playback capabilities for detected musical notes.

## Core Features

### 1. Real-time Pitch Detection
- Microphone input capture and processing
- Real-time frequency analysis using Web Audio API
- Pitch detection using the Pitchy library
- Note name mapping (C4-B4 range)
- Visual feedback of detected frequency and note

### 2. Audio Visualization
- Real-time frequency spectrum visualization
- Color-coded frequency bars
- Minimum volume threshold indicator
- Detected pitch highlighting
- Responsive canvas-based visualization

### 3. Recording and Playback
- Start/Stop recording functionality
- Note event tracking with timing information
- Melody playback capability
- Visual highlighting during playback
- Duration-based note filtering

### 4. Parameter Controls
- Minimum volume threshold (-60dB to 0dB)
- Minimum clarity percentage (0-100%)
- Minimum pitch frequency (20-2000 Hz)
- Maximum pitch frequency (20-20000 Hz)
- Minimum note duration (0.05-1.0 seconds)

### 5. Results Display
- Real-time frequency and note display
- Timeline visualization of detected notes
- Tabular data display with:
  - Note names
  - Frequencies
  - Durations
- Interactive playback controls

## Technical Requirements

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern web browser with Web Audio API support
- Microphone access permissions
- JavaScript ES6+ support

### Dependencies
- Pitchy library for pitch detection
- Web Audio API for audio processing
- Canvas API for visualization

### Performance Requirements
- Real-time audio processing
- Smooth visualization updates
- Responsive UI during recording
- Efficient memory usage for long recordings

### User Interface
- Clean, modern dark theme
- Responsive layout
- Intuitive controls
- Clear visual feedback
- Accessible color scheme

## Security Requirements
- Secure microphone access handling
- Proper cleanup of audio resources
- No data persistence (in-memory only)

## Error Handling
- Microphone access error handling
- Audio context initialization error handling
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features

## Future Considerations
- Extended note range support
- Multiple instrument detection
- Recording export functionality
- Custom visualization themes
- Advanced audio analysis features
